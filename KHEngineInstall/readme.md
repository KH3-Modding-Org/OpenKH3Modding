# KHEngineInstall.ps1
(Formerly NarkEngine_Install.ps1)

Here's a helper script to install the Custom Unreal Engine (aka NarkEngine / KHEngine) and Unreal Project (aka TresGame) for Kingdom Hearts 3. ðŸ™‚ 

The tool automates the steps descibed in the guide for [uProject and Engine installation via GitHub](https://github.com/KH3-Modding-Org/OpenKH3Modding/blob/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md#2-github-clone-install---update-with-the-click-of-a-button). Common pitfalls are checked and avoided.

#### Steps (provided by @Narknon)
1) Select which engine repository to use (NarkEngine / RynEngine / ...). Use NarkEngine if you don't know which one to pick!
2) Check if git is installed or guide users to the DL page
3) Get engine installation Path from user
4) Clone the engine repository to disk
5) Get project installation Path from user
6) Clone the project repository to disk
7) Initalize engine via setup.bat
8) Run generateprojectfiles.bat
9) Register new engine path
10) Switch project to new engine (also generating .sln file)
11) Check for CPU incompatibilities
12) Launch project with new engine

## Requirements (will be checked/guided during runtime)
- Linked Epic and Github Accounts
- git.exe in path
- Plenty of disk space (~20GB)

## How to run?
1) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/KH3-Modding-Org/OpenKH3Modding/blob/main/KHEngineInstall/KHEngineInstall.zip)
2) Extract archive to disk
3) Run start.bat
4) Follow the on-screen prompts closely and it should guide you through.
