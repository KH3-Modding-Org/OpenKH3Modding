### uProject and Engine Installation

For instructions on installing the uProject and custom engine, go [here](https://github.com/narknon/OpenKH3Modding/blob/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md).

Make sure you install all [prerequisites](https://github.com/narknon/OpenKH3Modding/blob/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md#prerequisites).

For standard install, see [option 1](https://github.com/narknon/OpenKH3Modding/edit/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md#1-standard-install---no-easy-updating).

For install along with Github desktop to allow for easy updates see [option 2](https://github.com/narknon/OpenKH3Modding/edit/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md#2-github-clone-install---update-with-the-click-of-a-button).  

For troubleshooting see [section 3](https://github.com/narknon/OpenKH3Modding/edit/main/uProject%20and%20Engine%20Installation.md#3-troubleshooting).

I highly recommend following option 2, as you can update with the click of a button and updates will only download changed files.  Further, you can even backup your project to a private branch of the uproject.  Only you and those you add as collaborators can access a private branch, and if your harddrive is ever lost, or you lose/break a file, you can always revert to an old commit and restore it!
